## Installation

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Ekansh38/Ball-Physics-In-Rust.git

   ```

2. Install Dependencies

   ```sh
   pip install pygame

   pip3 install pygame

   python3 -m pip install pygame
   ```

3. Run the project

## Features

- Drag and throw balls with mouse
- Balls have gravity and friction
- Euler Integration

## Contributing

I would love for anyone to contribute to this project and make it better in anyway possible. (because I am not that good at coding)
